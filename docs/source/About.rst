Premise
--------

``Whitetail`` is a lightweight alternative to ELK for non-intensive applications. It is built with containerization in mind for a non-resource intensive log viewer with basic metadata search capabilites.

Data Storage
------------
Data is stored in ``Whitetail`` through the use of a ``Ceres`` database.  The ``Ceres`` project can be found here_
