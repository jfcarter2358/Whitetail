# Whitetail

## Premise
Whitetail is a lightweight alternative to ELK for non-intensive applications. It is built with containerization in mind for a non-resource intensive log viewer with basic search capabilites.

## TO DO
- [] Add settings page
- [] Add docker file
- [] Add query language so that it's not just a keyword search on the logs page
- [] Add a log refresh button on the logs page
- [] Any other tasks I'll inevitably think of later
